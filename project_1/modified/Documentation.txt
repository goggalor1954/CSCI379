#
# The programs TCP_client.py and TCP_server.py use the TCP protocol to send and receive messages.
# They both use the port number 9999 to transmit messages.
# 
# the program TCP_server must be running before TCP client in order to operate.
#
# the default hostname of the TCP_server is the loopback address. 
# If an argument is passed to TCP_client the value of the first argument will be TCP_server hostname.
# if an invalid or unreachable ip address is passed as an argument TCP_client will not run.  
# The user of TCP_client enters a sentence to be modified. TCP client transmits this sentence in the form of a string to TCP_server on port 9999. 
# The user of TCP_client entered a command to modify the sentence. TCP_client transmits this command in the form of a string to TCP_server on port 9999.
# 
# TCP_server receives a sentence in the form of a string and an command from TCP_client in the form of a string.
# if the command value is valid the sentence is modified based on the value.
# If the command value is invalid a message stating so replaces the sentence.
#
# the valid commands are listed as follows:
# Upper: changes all letters in the string to upper case.
# Lower: changes all letters in the string to lower case.
# Swap: Change all the upper case letters to lower case letters and change all the lower case letters to uppercase letters.
# Rev: reverse the order of the words in the string.
# Cap: capitalize the first letter of the string. change all other letters to lower case.
# KILL: Kills the process running on the server. Returns a message confirming this.
#
# TCP_server transmits the modified sentence back to TCP_client using port 9999.
# In most cases TCP_server stays online and waits for the process to repeat.
# If the KILL command was received, then the socket closes and the program terminates.
